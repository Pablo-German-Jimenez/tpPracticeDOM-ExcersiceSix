# 🧪 Practical Project: DOM and BOM — Interactive Countdown Timer

This project was created as part of a practical assignment focused on **DOM (Document Object Model)** and **BOM (Browser Object Model)** usage in web development.

The goal was to build an **interactive countdown timer** where the user can input a starting time, and the timer counts down from there. It includes basic controls such as **Start**, **Pause**, and **Reset**, plus visual and audio effects to enhance the user experience.

- **HTML5** → semantic structure for the webpage.
- **CSS3** → styling and animations for breakdance-inspired visuals.
- **JavaScript (JS)** → core logic and interaction with DOM/BOM.
- **Bootstrap** → responsive layout and UI components.

## 📦 Features
